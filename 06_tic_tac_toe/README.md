## Overview of App

###### This is my sixth official react native app made by a tutorial and it is also my first mobile game, a simple game, i believe this is one of the first games that can be done in any language. As I am always trying to do it, I am making modifications to the code of the tutorial itself in order to apply my studies.

###### This app is a youtube tutorial from the [Code Workbench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU1MPgvdE1I) channel.

## Funcionalities

###### This is a small app, I studied it to see how thinking works when it comes to react native games, so as to get the logic. Basically, he has the game and a checker to check the winner, and so to reject the game through useStates

## New Things

###### This app does not have many new features, but it gives me a new way to think about creating elements dynamically, as an example the game board. As in other projects, I am not going to list elements and components that I have seen, just new things.
