## Overview of App

###### This app was really cool to produce, now I can observe and get a sense of how everything happens, I learned how to make requests to a time API with axios, which I believe is the most popular way to make requests for API's, we got it return the entered city and display all future weather data. The project is well componentized, and with the folder systems well organized Use some cool things that I will be listing below the README.md.

###### This app is a youtube tutorial from the [Sujeito Programador](https://www.youtube.com/c/Sujeitoprogramador/featured) channel.

## Funcionalities

###### As I mentioned earlier, we are here making requests for a weather API, we also have several different screens, we have features to check if the place is day or night, and thus display a different color to the user. We have a navigation drawer. A key for the API and a system of search and exchange of icons very cool and interesting ... Among other things!

## New Things

###### In this app I detailed several things I used, as the repository is growing, I don't know if I have already mentioned some here... But I believe that there are no duplicates in the list... However, I left it very detailed! Things like axios, expo-location and some other features, this app has a very interesting layout and a form of componentization and smart styling / positioning, so that I have learned and understood other ways of thinking
