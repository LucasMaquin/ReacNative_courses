## __Repository content__
###### This repository was created with the intention of storing all my **history of tutorials**, **courses,** and my learning progress that I am going through. 
###### In each folder, detail each application or project, describing the new technologies used / learned. This is the process I'm going through to learn how to produce applications with React Native

<br>

## __Student__
###### I am an **information systems** student at the university and I already have a completed IT technician. I basically work with **HTML**, **CSS** and **javascript** and I want to learn to develop mobile, I believe that the closest technology to javascript is React Native, so I started with it. 
###### I will be glad if you talk to me to add something to my progress line of studies!

<br>

#### Remembering this is a repository made by someone interested in this technology.
