## Overview of App

###### This is my first app creating in snacks on the expo! And this is the second tutorial I did creating games in react native, this time the famous flappy bird, I believe that his logic was very well applied, componentizing the pipes and also the bird, making everything very clear and easy to understand, again these tutorials of games I did in order to create a better logic in relation to programming

###### This app is a youtube tutorial from the [Code with Ania Kub√≥w](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw) channel.

## Funcionalities

###### Basically the game is a component that when clicked adds positioning values, in this case the bird is a component that renders several and several times repeated with an interval of time, in the case the pipes

## New Things

###### I loved the logic of this game, it is something that is simple and does not seem ... I did it thinking about the peculiarities of logic and how I can use it to improve mine!
