## Overview of App
###### This is my third app with react native, here I already had a base and already had a notion of the basic things, in this app i use expo too to easier.
###### This app is a youtube tutorial from the [Made With Matt](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHgS0H3T3459H1e9QWK_Ezg) channel.

## Funcionalities
###### This is also a relatively simple app. A to do app, where the user can add tasks to improve their organization. 
###### it's not a complete app, it's just a small sample to see other react native features. So making progress gradually, without skipping steps.

## New Things
###### This is my third app that I produced and my second To do List app this is a version that doesnâ€™t use advanced features like AsyncStorage, simplifying things and improving the layout, basically it was an app that I produced to improve and feel the styles of css in react native.
###### I will not repeat features that I already know in the list of "new things" so the only notable topic that this app made me evolve was the css style
