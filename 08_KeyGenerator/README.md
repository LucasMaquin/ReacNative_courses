    <h2>Project Repository</h2>
</div>

## Overview of App

###### This is a simple project, but I could not leave it out of the repository, it is an initial project to enter into a more complex project that I will be posting here in the future. This project has only one screen where a random password is generated depending on the number of characters that the user wants. Use some cool things that I will be listing below the README.md.

###### This app is a youtube tutorial from the [Sujeito Programador](https://www.youtube.com/c/Sujeitoprogramador/featured) channel.

## Funcionalities

###### It has a slider, which it has never used before and this slider selects the number of characters that the user wants to have the password generated, after the user selects this, he can click on a button and generate the password. To copy the password just do a longPress and it will be copied (I had never used this event yet).

## New Things

###### As I mentioned earlier, this is an introductory app for a more complex one that will also be posted in the main repository, and in this one the new features that I saw basically were the slider, longPress and the logic for creating the password, which was through the function javascript charAt.
