## Overview of App

###### 

###### This app is a youtube tutorial from the [DesignIntoCode](https://www.youtube.com/c/DesignIntoCode/featured) channel.

## Funcionalities

###### This is my fourth official app, in it I learned several things, it is my first app that I had contact with a database, in this case it was google's firebase, I loved working with it ...

###### I have already produced several "to do" apps, but having this integration with the database made me more anxious and excited, I was able to learn several concepts, removing these particularities, it is a common app, being able to add, remove and complete tasks, where each one of them is stored and pulled from the database

## New Things

###### I learned how to configure the bank, make a simple CRUD, I used a file for color standardization, a modal, I used our lovely flat list, KeyboardAvoidingView.
###### One of the most interesting things about this app is that it uses class components, things that donâ€™t get much more ...
