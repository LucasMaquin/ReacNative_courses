## Overview of App
###### This is my second app with react native, here I already had a base and already had a notion of the basic things, in this app i use expo too to easier.
###### This app is a youtube tutorial from the [SujeitoProgramador](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLc5Bq2yfs-S3Zse3ZFRMEQ) channel.

## Funcionalities
###### This is also a relatively simple app. A to do app, where the user can add tasks to improve their organization. 
###### The app has two screens, one to view the tasks and another to register them, it's not a complete app, it's just a small sample to see other react native features. So making progress gradually, without skipping steps.

## New Things
###### As this is my second application, many things is new, but I have listed the most important things that I find interesting. I will not repeat news from past projects, only features added in this app. As I mentioned it is a two screen app, so my first component was created in addition to the app.js and used icons, animations and an asyncStorage!
